NAME="id1.2."
>What is BNF?</A
></H3
><P
>Backus-Naur notation (more commonly known as BNF or Backus-Naur Form)
is a formal mathematical way to describe a language, which was
developed by John Backus (and possibly Peter Naur as well) to describe
the syntax of the Algol 60 programming language. &#13;</P
><P
>(Legend has it that it was primarily developed by John Backus (based
on earlier work by the mathematician Emil Post), but adopted and
slightly improved by Peter Naur for Algol 60, which made it
well-known.  Because of this Naur calls BNF Backus Normal Form, while
everyone else calls it Backus-Naur Form.)&#13;</P
><P
>It is used to formally define the grammar of a language, so that there
is no disagreement or ambiguity as to what is allowed and what is
not. In fact, BNF is so unambiguous that there is a lot of
mathematical theory around these kinds of grammars, and one can
actually mechanically construct a parser for a language given a BNF
grammar for it. (There are some kinds of grammars for which this isn't
possible, but they can usually be transformed manually into ones that
can be used.)&#13;</P
><P
>Programs that do this are commonly called "compiler compilers". The
most famous of these is YACC, but there are many more.</P
><H2
><A
NAME="id2."
>How it works</A
></H2
><H3
><A
NAME="id2.1."
>The principles</A
></H3
><P
>BNF is sort of like a mathematical game: you start with a symbol
(called the start symbol and by convention usually named S in
examples) and are then given rules for what you can replace this
symbol with. The language defined by the BNF grammar is just the set
of all strings you can produce by following these rules.&#13;</P
><P
>The rules are called production rules, and look like this:
<pre
><code
>  symbol := alternative1 | alternative2 ...</code
></pre
>&#13;</P
><P
>A production rule simply states that the symbol on the left-hand side
of the := must be replaced by one of the alternatives on the right
hand side. The alternatives are separated by |s. (One variation on
this is to use ::= instead of :=, but the meaning is the same.)
Alternatives usually consist of both symbols and something called
terminals. Terminals are simply pieces of the final string that are
not symbols. They are called terminals because there are no production
rules for them: they terminate the production process. (Symbols are
often called non-terminals.)&#13;</P
><P
>Another variation on BNF grammars is to enclose terminals in quotes to
distinguish them from symbols. Some BNF grammars explicitly show where
whitespace is allowed by having a symbol for it, while other grammars
leave this for the reader to infer.&#13;</P
><P
>There is one special symbol in BNF: @, which simply means that
the symbol can be removed. If you replace a symbol by @, you do
it by just removing the symbol. This is useful because in some cases
it is difficult to end the replacement process without using this
trick.&#13;</P
><P
>So, the language described by a grammar is the set of all strings you
can produce with the production rules. If a string cannot in any way
be produced by using the rules the string is not allowed in the
language.</P
><H3

NAME="id2.2."
>A real example</A
></H3
><P
>Below is a sample BNF grammar:
<pre
><code
>  S  := '-' FN |
        FN
  FN := DL |
        DL '.' DL
  DL := D |
        D DL
  D  := '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'</code
></pre
>&#13;</P
><P
>The different symbols here are all abbreviations: S is the start
symbol, FN produces a fractional number, DL is a digit list, while D
is a digit.&#13;</P
><P
>Valid sentences in the language described by this grammar are all
numbers, possibly fractional, and possibly negative. To produce a
number, start with the start symbol S:&#13;</P
><pre
>  S</pre
><P
>Then replace the S symbol with one of its productions. In this case we
choose not to put a '-' in front of the number, so we use the plain FN
production and replace S by FN:&#13;</P
><pre
>  FN</pre
><P
>The next step is then to replace the FN symbol with one of its
productions.  We want a fractional number, so we choose the production
that creates two decimal lists with a '.' between them, and after that
we keep choosing replacing a symbol with one of its productions once
per line in the example below:&#13;</P
><pre
>  DL . DL

  D . DL

  3 . DL

  3 . D DL

  3 . D D

  3 . 1 D

  3 . 1 4</pre
><P
>Here we've produced the fractional number 3.14. How to produce the
number -5 is left as an exercise for the reader. To make sure you
understand this you should also study the grammar until you understand
why the string 3..14 cannot be produced with these production rules.&#13;</P
><H3
><A
NAME="id2.3."
>EBNF: What is it, and why do we need it?</A
></H3
><P
>In DL I had to use recursion (ie: DL can produce new DLs) to express
the fact that there can be any number of Ds. This is a bit awkward and
makes the BNF harder to read.  Extended BNF (EBNF, of course) solves
this problem by adding three operators:&#13;</P
><UL
><LI
>? : which means that the symbol (or group of symbols in parenthesis)
          to the left of the operator is optional (it can appear zero or
          one times)
  </LI
><LI
>* : which means that something can be repeated any number of times
          (and possibly be skipped altogether)
  </LI
><LI
>+ : which means that something can appear one or more times</LI
></UL
><H3
><A
NAME="id2.4."
>An EBNF sample grammar</A
></H3
><P
>So in extended BNF the above grammar can be written as:
<pre
><code
>  S := '-'? D+ ('.' D+)?

  D := '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'</code
></pre
>
  &#13;</P
><P
>which is rather nicer. :)&#13;</P
><P
>Just for the record: EBNF is not more powerful than BNF in terms of
what languages it can define, just more convenient. Any EBNF
production can be translated into an equivalent set of BNF
productions.</P

>Uses of BNF and EBNF</A
></H2
><H3
><A
NAME="id3.1."
>Common uses</A
></H3
><P
>Most programming language standards use some variant of EBNF to define
the grammar of the language. This has two advantages: there can be no
disagreement on what the syntax of the language is, and it makes it
much easier to make compilers, because the parser for the compiler can
be generated automatically with a compiler-compiler like YACC.&#13;</P
><P
>EBNF is also used in many other standards, such as definitions of
protocol formats, data formats and markup languages such as XML and
SGML. (HTML is not defined with a grammar, instead it is defined with
an SGML DTD, which is sort of a higher-level grammar.)&#13;</P
><P
>You can see a collection of BNF grammars at the <A

><H3
><A
NAME="id3.2."
>How to use a formal grammar</A
></H3
><P
>OK. Now you know what BNF and EBNF are, what they are used for, but
perhaps not why they are useful or how you can take advantage of them.&#13;</P
><P
>The most obvious way of using a formal grammar has already been
mentioned in passing: once you've given a formal grammar for your
language you have completely defined it. There can be no further
disagreement on what is allowed in the language and what is not.  This
is extremely useful because a syntax description in ordinary prose is
much more verbose and open to different interpretations.</P
><P
>Another benefit is this: formal grammars are mathematical creatures
and can be "understood" by computers. There are actually lots of
programs that can be given (E)BNF grammars as input and automatically
produce code for parsers for the given grammar. In fact, this is the
most common way to produce a compiler: by using a so-called
compiler-compiler that takes a grammar as input and produces parser
code in some programming language.&#13;</P
><P
>Of course, compilers do much more checking than just grammar checking
(such as type checking) and they also produce code. None of these
things are described in an (E)BNF grammar, so compiler-compilers
usually have a special syntax for associating code snippets (called
actions) with the different productions in the grammar.&#13;</P
><P
>The best-known compiler-compiler is YACC (Yet Another Compiler
Compiler), which produces C code, but others exist for C++, Java,
Python as well as many other languages.</P

NAME="id4.1."
>The easiest way</A
></H3
><H4
><A
NAME="id4.1.1."
>Top-down parsing (LL)</A
></H4
><P
>The easiest way of parsing something according to a grammar in use
today is called LL parsing (or top-down parsing). It works like this:
for each production find out which terminals the production can
start with. (This is called the start set.)</P
><P
>Then, when parsing, you just start with the start symbol and compare
the start sets of the different productions against the first piece of
input to see which of the productions have been used. Of course, this
can only be done if no two start sets for one symbol both contain the
same terminal. If they do there is no way to determine which
production to choose by looking at the first terminal on the input.&#13;</P
><P
>LL grammars are often classified by numbers, such as LL(1), LL(0) and
so on. The number in the parenthesis tells you the maximum number of
terminals you may have to look at at a time to choose the right
production at any point in the grammar. So for LL(0) you don't have to
look at any terminals at all, you can always choose the right
production. This is only possible if all symbols have only one
production, and if they only have one production the language can only
have one string. In other words: LL(0) grammars are not interesting.&#13;</P
><P
>The most common (and useful) kind of LL grammar is LL(1) where you can
always choose the right production by looking at only the first
terminal on the input at any given time. With LL(2) you have to look
at two symbols, and so on. There exist grammars that are not LL(k)
grammars for any fixed value of k at all, and they are sadly quite
common.</P
><H4
><A
NAME="id4.1.2."
>An LL analysis example</A
></H4
><P
>As a demonstration, let's do a start set analysis of the sample
grammar above. For the symbol D this is easy: all productions have a
single digit as their start set (the one they produce) and the D
symbol has the set of all ten digits as its start set. This means that
we have at best an LL(1) grammar, since in this case we need to look
at one terminal to choose the right production.&#13;</P
><P
>With DL we run into trouble. Both productions start with D and thus
both have the same start set. This means that one cannot see which
production to choose by looking at just the first terminal of the
input. However, we can easily get round this problem by cheating: if
the second terminal on input is <EM
>not</EM
> a digit we must have used
the first production, but if they both are digits we must have used
the second one. In other words, this means that this is at best an
LL(2) grammar.&#13;</P
><P
>I actually simplified things a little here. The productions for DL
alone don't tells us which terminals are allowed after the first
terminal in the D @ production, because we need to know which
terminals are allowed after a DL symbol. This set of terminals is
called the follow set of the symbol, and in this case it is '.' and
the end of input. &#13;</P
><P
>The FN symbol turns out to be even worse, since both productions have
all digits as their start set. Looking at the second terminal doesn't
help since we need to look at the first terminal after the last digit
in the digit list (DL) and we don't know how many digits there are
until we've read them all. And since there is no limit on the number
of digits there can be, this isn't an LL(k) grammar for any value of k
at all (there can always be more digits than k, no matter which value
of k value you choose).&#13;</P
><P
>Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, the S symbol is easy. The first
production has '-' as its start set, the second one has all digits. In
other words, when you start parsing you'll start with the S symbol and
look at the input to decide which production was used. If the first
terminal is '-' you know that the first production was used. If not,
the second one was used. It's only the FN and DL productions that
cause problems.</P
><H4
><A
NAME="id4.1.3."
>An LL transformation example</A
></H4
><P
>However, there is no need to despair. Most grammars that are not LL(k)
can fairly easily be converted to LL(1) grammars. In this case we'll
need to change two symbols: FN and DL.&#13;</P
><P
>The problem with FN is that both productions begin with DL, but the
second one continues with a '.' and another DL after the initial DL.
This is easily solved: we change FN to have just one production that
starts with DL followed by FP (fractional part), where FP can be
nothing or '.' followed by a DL, like this:</P
><pre
>  FN := DL FP
  FP := @ | '.' DL</pre
><P
>Now there are no problems with FN anymore, since there's just one
production, and FP is unproblematic because the two productions have
different start sets. End of input and '.', respectively.</P
><P
>The DL is a tougher nut to crack, since the problem is the recursion
and it's compounded by the fact that we need at least one D to result from
the DL. The solution is to give DL a single production, a D followed by DR
(digits rest). DR then has two productions: D DR (more digits) or @ (no more
digits). The first production has a start set of all digits, while the
second has '.' and end of input as its start set, so this solves the problem.</P
><P
>This is the complete LL(1) grammar as we've now transformed it:</P
><pre
>  S  := '-' FN | FN
  FN := DL FP
  FP := @ | '.' DL
  DL := D DR
  DR := D DR | @
  D  := '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'</pre

><A
NAME="id4.2.1."
>Bottom-up parsing (LR)</A
></H4
><P
>A harder way to parse is the one known as shift-reduce or bottom-up
parsing. This technique collects input until it finds that it can
reduce an input sequence with a symbol. This may sound difficult, so
I'll give an example to clarify. We'll parse the string '3.14' and see
how it was produced from the grammar. We start by reading 3 from the
input:</P
><pre
>  3</pre
><P
>and then we look to see if we can reduce it to the symbol it was
produced from. And indeed we can, it was produced from the D symbol,
which we replace the 3 with. Then we note that we can produce the D
from DL and replace the D with DL. (The grammar is ambiguous, which
means that we can reduce further to FN, which would be wrong. For
simplicity we just skip the wrong steps here, but an unambiguous
grammar would not allow these wrong choices.) After that we read the
. from the input and try to reduce it, but fail:</P
><pre
>  D

  DL

  DL .</pre
><P
>This can't be reduced to anything, so we read the next character from
the input: 1. We then reduce that to a D and read the next character,
which is 4. 4 can be reduced to D, then to DL, and then the "D DL"
sequence can be further reduced to a DL.</P
><pre
>  DL .

  DL . 1

  DL . D

  DL . D 4

  DL . D D
  
  DL . D DL
  
  DL . DL</pre
><P
>Looking at the grammar we quickly note that FN can produce just this
"DL . DL" sequence and do a reduction. We then note that FN can be
produced from S and reduce the FN to S and then stop, as we've
completed the parse.</P
><pre
>  DL . DL

  FN

  S</pre
><P
>As you may have noted we could often choose whether to do a reduction
now or wait until we had more symbols and then do a different
reduction. There are more complex variations on this shift-reduce
parsing algorithm, in increasing complexity and power: LR(0), SLR,
LALR and LR(1). LR(1) usually needs unpractically large parse tables,
so LALR is the most commonly used algorithm, since SLR and LR(0) are
not powerful enough for most programming languages.</P

>LALR and LR(1) are too complex for me to cover here, but you get the
basic idea.</P

><PRE
>I hope this doesn't start a war...

First - - Frank, if you see this, don't shoot me.  (My boss is Frank
DeRemer, the creator of LALR parsing...)

(I borrowed this summary from Fischer&#38;LeBlanc's "Crafting a Compiler")

  Simplicity    - - LL
  Generality    - - LALR
  Actions       - - LL
  Error repair  - - LL
  Table sizes   - - LL
  Parsing speed - - comparable (me: and tool-dependent)

Simplicity - - LL wins
==========
The workings of an LL parser are much simpler.  And, if you have to
debug a parser, looking at a recursive-descent parser (a common way to
program an LL parser) is much simpler than the tables of a LALR parser.

Generality - - LALR wins
==========
For ease of specification, LALR wins hands down.  The big
difference here between LL and (LA)LR is that in an LL grammar you must
left-factor rules and remove left recursion.

Left factoring is necessary because LL parsing requires selecting an
alternative based on a fixed number of input tokens.

Left recursion is problematic because a lookahead token of a rule is
always in the lookahead token on that same rule.  (Everything in set A
is in set A...)  This causes the rule to recurse forever and ever and
ever and ever...

To see ways to convert LALR grammars to LL grammars, take a look at my
page on it:
  http://www.jguru.com/thetick/articles/lalrtoll.html

Many languages already have LALR grammars available, so you'd have to
translate.  If the language _doesn't_ have a grammar available, then I'd
say it's not really any harder to write a LL grammar from scratch.  (You
just have to be in the right "LL" mindset, which usually involves
watching 8 hours of Dr. Who before writing the grammar...  I actually
prefer LL if you didn't know...)


Actions - - LL wins
=======
In an LL parser you can place actions anywhere you want without
introducing a conflict

Error repair - - LL wins
============
LL parsers have much better context information (they are top-down
parsers) and therefore can help much more in repairing an error, not to
mention reporting errors.

Table sizes - - LL
===========
Assuming you write a table-driven LL parser, its tables are nearly half
the size.  (To be fair, there are ways to optimize LALR tables to make
them smaller, so I think this one washes...)

Parsing speed - comparable (me: and tool-dependent)</PRE
